# Setup Oracle Container Pipelines (Wercker) to Enable CI/CD for WebLogic Application #

**Oracle Container Pipelines (Wercker)** is a Docker-Native CI/CD  Automation platform for Kubernetes & Microservice Deployments. Wercker is integrated with Docker containers, which package up application code and can be easily moved from server to server. Each build artifact can be a Docker container. The user can take the container from the Docker Hub or his private registry and build the code before shipping it. Its SaaS platform enables developers to test and deploy code often. They can push software updates incrementally as they are ready, rather than in bundled dumps. It makes it easier for coders to practice continuous integration, a software engineering practice in which each change a developer makes to the codebase is constantly tested in the process so that software doesnâ€™t break when it goes live.

Oracle Container Pipelines is based on the concept of pipelines, which are automated workflows. Pipelines take pieces of code and automatically execute a series of steps upon that code.

This tutorial demonstrates how to create Oracle Container Pipelines application (CI/CD) to build/update custom WebLogic container image using customized Docker image or official WebLogic image from Docker Store as base source.

The custom WebLogic Domain has the following components configured/deployed:

- Web Application to demonstrate WebLogic Operator features and application life cycle management
- JDBC DataSource to demonstrate WebLogic Operator override feature

The key components of Oracle Container Pipelines:

+ **Step** is self-contained bash script or compiled binary for accomplishing specific automation tasks.
+ **Pipelines** are a series of steps that are triggered on a git push or the completion of another pipeline.
+ **Workflows** are a set of chained and branched pipelines that allow you to form multi-stage, multi-branch complex CI/CD flows that take your project from code to production.
+ All pipelines execute inside a **Docker container** and every build artefact can be a Docker container.

### Prerequisites ###

- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure) enabled account.
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) account.
- [Github ](sign.up.github.md) account.
- [Oracle Container Pipeline](sign.up.wercker.md)

#### Prepare Oracle Container Registry access ####

Before you create your build pipeline you need to get your Oracle Container Registry token. Token acts as password to container registry provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Open your OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) Console. If necessary Sign in again using your Cloud Services link you got in email during the registration process. Remember on the dashboard you need to click the menu icon at the top left corner and select **Compute** on the left sliding menu.

![alt text](images/oke/003.compute.console.png)

Using the OCI console page click the user icon and select **User Settings**. On the left area of the User details page select the **Auth Tokens** item. Click the **Generate Token** to get a new token.

![alt text](images/ocir/001.user.settings.auth.token.png)

Enter a description which allows you to easily identify the allocated token later. For example if you want to revoke then you have to find the proper token to delete. For example *ocir*.

![alt text](images/ocir/002.generate.token.png)

Now **copy and store(!)** your generated token for later usage. Click **Close**.

![alt text](images/ocir/003.copy.token.png)

Since you are on the User details page please note the proper user name for later usage. You need to use this user name in order to login to OCI Registry for push and pull images.

#### Accept Licence Agreement to use `store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.4` image from Docker Store ####

If you have not used the base image [`store/oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.4`](https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-weblogic-server-12c) before, you will need to visit the [Docker Store web interface](https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-weblogic-server-12c) and accept the license agreement before the Docker Store will give you permission to pull that image.

Open [https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-weblogic-server-12c](https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-weblogic-server-12c) in a new browser and click **Log In**.

![alt text](images/docker/01.docker.store.weblogic.png)

Enter your account details and click **Login**.

![](images/docker/02.docker.store.login.png)

Click **Proceed to Checkout**.

![alt text](images/docker/03.docker.store.weblogic.checkout.png)

Complete your contact information and accept agreements. Click **Get Content**.

![alt text](images/docker/04.docker.store.weblogic.get.content.png)

Now you are ready to pull the  image on Docker enabled host after authenticating yourself in Docker Hub using your Docker Hub credentials.

#### Import WebLogic Operator Tutorial's source repository into your Github repository ####

In this step you will fork the tutorial's source repository. The source repository contains the demo application deployed on top of WebLogic server, configuration yaml to quickly create Oracle Container Pipelines(CI/CD) application to build custom WebLogic image and few additional Kubernetes configuration files to deploy the custom WebLogic image.

Open the *https://github.com/tazlambert/weblogic-operator-tutorial.git* repository in your browser. Click the **Fork** button at the left top area. Sign in to github.com if necessary.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/001.fork.repository.png)

Wait until the fork process is complete.

#### Create Oracle Container Pipelines Application to build custom WebLogic Docker container including demo application ####

First create your Oracle Container Pipelines application. Oracle Container Pipelines acts as continuous integration tool which will produce WebLogic container image and uploads to Oracle Container Registry.

The following pipelines are predefined in the Oracle Container Pipelines configuration file ([wercker.yml](https://github.com/nagypeter/weblogic-operator-tutorial/blob/master/wercker.yml)):

- **build**: Default and mandatory pipeline to start the workflow. It builds the demo Web Application using Maven.
- **build-domain-in-home-image**: Pipeline which runs Docker build to create custom WebLogic container image. 
  When no *latest* image available in repository it uses official WebLogic image from Docker Store as base image and runs WLST script to customise the image. Also copies the demo Web Application into the image and deploys using WLST. 
   When *latest* (tag) of the image is available in the repository then the workflow just builds the Web Application and update the *latest* image with the new application binaries. 
   After the Docker build the pipeline produces a new image and pushes to the image repository (OCIR). Thus every time when changes happen in the sources and committed to Github. The image tag will be the commit hash tag of the source changes  which triggered the new build process. Also the historically latest gets the *latest* tag as well.
- **deploy-to-cluster**: This pipeline will pull the image from image repository (OCIR) and deploy the image to the destined Kubernetes cluster.

[Sign in to Oracle Container Pipelines (former Wercker)](https://app.wercker.com/) and click **Create your first application** button or the **+** icon at the top right corner and select *Add Application*.

NOTE! If you need to sign up to Oracle Container Pipelines do it with your Github account. Click the **LOG IN WITH GITHUB** button and authorise Oracle Container Pipelines application for your Github account. You can revoke Oracle Container Pipelines's authorisation request anytime using your Github's profile settings.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/003.new.application.png)

Select the owner of the application. By default it is your Oracle Container Pipelines username, but it can be any organization where you belong to. Make sure the selected SCM is *GitHub*. Click **Next**.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/004.application.user.repo.png)

Select *weblogic-operator-tutorial* repository what you imported previously. Click **Next**.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/005.select.repository.png)

Leave the default repository access without SSH key. Click **Next**.

![](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/006.application.repo.access.png)

If you want you can make your application public if you want to share the application's status otherwise leave the default private settings. Click **Create**.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/007.create.application.png)

The repository already contains a necessary `wercker.yml` but before the execution provide the following key/value pairs:

| Key | Value | Note |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OCI_REGISTRY_USERNAME | your_cloud_username |  The username what you note during user settings. e.g. oracleidentitycloudservice/john.p.smith@example.com |
| OCI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | OCIR Auth Token | The Auth Token you generated previously |
| TENANCY | Name of your registry | To store and retrieve image from OCIR |
| REGION | The code of your home region. See the [documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Registry/Concepts/registryprerequisites.htm#Availab) to get your region code. | e.g. `fra` - stands for *eu-frankfurt-1* |
| DOCKER_USERNAME | Your Docker Hub username | Necessary to pull official WebLogic Server image from Docker Store |
| DOCKER_PASSWORD | Your Docker Hub password | Necessary to pull official WebLogic Server image from Docker Store |
| KUBERNETES_MASTER | Your OKE Public IP:Port | Necessary to push modified WebLogic Server image from Image Store (OCIR) |
| KUBERNETES_AUTH_TOKEN | Your OKE-ADMIN Token | Necessary to push modified WebLogic Server image from Image Store (OCIR) |

To define these variables click **<>Environment** tab and enter keys and values. Remember that these values will be visible to anyone to whom you give access to the Oracle Container Pipelines application, therefore select **Protected** for any values that should remain hidden, including all passwords.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/008.env.variables.png)

Click the **Worklflow** tab and then **Add new pipeline** to enable pipeline defined in *wercker.yml*.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/009.workflow.add.pipeline.png)

Enter the name of the pipeline and the "YML Pipeline Name" as *build-domain-in-home-image*. Please enter exactly this name - because this name is hardcoded in the *wercker.yml*. Click **Create**.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/010.add.pipeline.png)

Click again the **Worklflow** tab to get back to the editor page. Click the + sign after the mandatory *build* pipeline.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/011.add.pipeline.png)

Leave the default branch(es) configuration and select the *build-domain-in-home-image* pipeline.

![alt text](images/build.weblogic.pipeline/012.add.pipeline.details.png)

Now your workflow should be similar below, deploy-to-cluster will be added later:
